# FYS4150 Project 5 - Schrödinger equation

# Introduction

This repo contains code for simulating the two-dimensional time-dependent
Schrödinger equation. To do so, the Crank-Nicolson method for PDE's has been
implemented. We apply this to a double-slit-in-a-box setup and variations on
this. To better illustrate the results, there is a Python script for generating
animations and various plots.

The C++ script uses config1.in and config2.in with at double slit setup, and
config3.in for a simple, double and triple slit setup. Running will produce in
all five binary files containing information about the system at each timestep.

# Usage

## Python

```
usage: src/plot.py [-h] [-f FILENAME] [-t] [-an] [-d] [-de] [-a]

For running the plotting

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILENAME, --filename FILENAME
                        The filename of the binary file to plot
  -t, --time_plots      To plot the probablity and the real and imaginary parts of the wave function for different time steps
  -an, --animation      To create an animation of probablity
  -d, --detect          Detect and plot at x=0.8 at the end of the simulation. Include filename
  -de, --deviation      Plot deviation from 1 of the total probability
  -a, --all             Produce all plots and animation
```

## C++

Compiling

```bash
make
```

Running

```
./runner
```

python and the header files for c++.

# Notation and indices

The indexing in the C++ code differs from the notation in the report. Here are
the major differences:

-   We use i to index the y-coordinates and j to index the x-coordinates
-   All indexing starts at 0.

# FYS4150 Project 5 - Schrödinger equation

# Introduction
This repo contains code for simulating the two-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
To do so, the Crank-Nicolson method for PDE's has been implemented. We apply this to a 
double-slit-in-a-box setup and variations on this. To better illustrate the results, there is 
a Python script for generating animations and various plots.

# FYS4150 Project 5 - Schrödinger equation

# Introduction
This repo contains code for simulating the two-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
To do so, the Crank-Nicolson method for PDE's has been implemented. We apply this to a 
double-slit-in-a-box setup and variations on this. To better illustrate the results, there is 
a Python script for generating animations and various plots.

The C++ script uses config1.in and config2.in with at double slit setup, and config3.in for
a simple, double and triple slit setup. Running will produce in all five binary files 
containing information about the system at each timestep.
